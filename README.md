### Selecting the optimum number of cluster

The WCSS value decreases when we increase the number of clusters.

If there is only one cluster, the WCSS is large. On the other hand, when we incease the number of centroids to be equal to the number of data points, then the WCSS value is zero as each data point is the centroid of itself and its distance to centroid is zero.

Elbow methos is a way to find the optimum number of clusters:
